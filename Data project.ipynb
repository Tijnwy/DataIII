    "## Probleemstelling\n",
    "\n",
    "Netflix maakt regelmatig beslissingen over de toekomst van series en films. Een productie kan soms meerdere seizoenen of vervolgfilms in de planning hebben staan, maar toch worden die dan geannuleerd. Dan kan de vraag ontstaan of het annuleren wel de juiste keuze was. \n",
    "\n",
    "Het annuleren van een vervolg op een film of serie wordt negatief ervaren door fans en kan de reputatie van Netflix verminderen, wat kan leiden tot minder abonnees en lagere kijkcijfers doordat niemand aan nieuwe shows of films begint.\n",
    "\n",
    "Door middel van een onderzoek naar kijkcijfers, reviews en ratings van de eerdere delen, en reacties van het publiek wil Netflix erachter komen of het annuleren de juiste beslissing was. De taak van het machine learning team is om de reviews om te werken naar sentimenten om deze te kunnen gebruiken in een machine learning model. En een dashboard te maken waarmee de statistieken van een extra seizoen voorspeld kunnen worden.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Zakelijk inzicht  \n",
    "Met behulp van dit onderzoek kan er worden gekeken naar de mogelijke performance van een volgend seizoen of vervolgfilm. Dit kan Netflix ondersteunen met onderbouwde keuzes maken, richting het annuleren van vervolgen om fans en abonnees tevreden te houden. Door te kijken naar de sentimenten, ratings en kijkcijfers kunnen zowel de bedrijfswinst en reputatie bij abonnees worden gewaarborgd. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Literatuur onderzoek\n",
    "Het onderzoek richt zich op sentiment analyse met behulp van Natural Language Processing (NLP), hiermee kunnen reviews van rotten tomatoes worden omgezet naar sentimenten. Na onderzoek is geen soort gelijk project waarmee het onderzoek vergeleken kan worden. \n",
    "\n",
    "Netflix is een online streaming service, via deze service kan eigen media en ook overgekochte media worden gestreamd. In het geval van dit Onderzoek zal het over de eigen media gaan, de Netflix Orginals. De Netflix Originals worden gemaakt door de Netflix studios, bij hen ligt dus ook de keuzes om deze te annuleren of vervolgen. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### vereisten informatie\n",
    "- Een database met informatie en details van films en series van Netflix media.\n",
    "- De belangrijke details zijn onder andere aantal seizoenen, aantal kijkers, release jaar, ratings, genre, regisseur, cast.\n",
    "- De ratings moeten bruikbaar zijn bij machine learning.\n",
    "- De tweets moeten omgezet worden naar een formaat dat bruikbaar is zodat een machine learning model er op kan trainen.\n",
    "- De Rotten tomatoes website moet kunnen worden gescrapped \n",
    "- De API moet gebonden worden aan titels in de dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Databronnen\n",
    "- Netflix series and movies Dataset: Netflix movies and TV shows. (2021, September 27). https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/netflix-shows/data\n",
    "- Rotten tomatoes: Rotten Tomatoes: movies | TV shows | Movie trailers | reviews. (n.d.). Rotten Tomatoes. https://www.rottentomatoes.com/\n",
    "- API TMDB Movie database: Getting started. (n.d.). The Movie Database (TMDB). https://developer.themoviedb.org/reference/intro/getting-started\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data verwerken\n",
    "- Dataset inladen naar DataFrame en klaar maken voor machine learning. Het verwijderen van de descriptions van de show/film en kolommen omzetten naar nummeriek bij bijvoorbeeld age rating een schaal van 1-5 maken.\n",
    "- De rotten tomatoes site wordt gescrapped voor reviews en ratings per show/film. Bij shows wordt ook gekeken naar het meest recente seizoen\n",
    "- Van TMDB wordt de data verzameld door middel van de API's\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Soort data\n",
    "- Dataset, gestructureerd: Er wordt gewerkt met een csv bestand waar elke rij een andere film/show betekent. \n",
    "- De rotten tomatoes, semi gestructureerd: De reviews kunnen worden gezien als ongestructureerd en de ratings als gestructureerd. Hierbij, dus de hele bron als semi gestructureerde data.\n",
    "- TMDB, semi gestructureerd: De informatie wordt behaald door API's te gebruiken. Deze API's worden aangeboden in een gestandaardiseerde vorm. Toch, wordt er voor Semi gestructureerd gekozen vanwege de gestructureerde en ongestructureerde variabele van dit format."

      "Review 1: This is a documentary that will hit many different people in many different ways depending on their past and present life experiences. Without getting too personal, in some ways I am living out a bit of what is happening in this movie and found parallels that are eerily accurate, including a need to help figure out the TV that happened just a few hours earlier today. As a result, this was a rather extraordinary experience for me. I'll be honest - when I first read the description of this movie, it sounded a bit off kilter, and I think it could have gone terribly wrong in numerous ways. But director/daughter Johnson is a smart cookie and finds a beautiful balance between the pain and the humor. While I expected to be moved - and I most certainly was - I was surprised by how often I smiled and laughed throughout. And it helps that Dick Johnson is just the loveliest man ever, a kind and gentle soul whose smile lights up a room and whose spirit is inspiring to us half his age. There are moments here I will truly never forget, and I'm not being hyperbolic. I think this will touch anyone who has gone through or is going through the experience of having an elderly parent or parents. Alternately hilarious and heartbreaking, I'll be thinking of Dick Johnson for a long time to come.\n",

I found myself growing a little impatient with the protaginist's obsession despite the cascading damaging consequences of her decisions/behavior on herself and those around her … a bit of a case study in the impacts of an 'ends justify the means' approach.  I am, however, now engaged in the story and will watch the next season when it comes out.\n",

      "Review 1: For my first time taking the MLP franchise somewhat seriously, it was a surprisingly pleasant experience. WIth notable actors like Kimiko Glenn, James Marsden, Ken Jeong, and Vanessa Hudgens, the characters were very interesting and entertaining as well. The movie has a serviceable plot, with a few here-and-there's that could be tweaked. A hilarious, kind-hearted film with a nice little moral to wrap it up nice and tight for all families to enjoy.\n",

      "Review 2: Ok, but this was horrible. I wish I could give it 0 stars. It's not the animation, or anything like that, it's the story. It's HORRIBLE. It's changed everything of the original My Little Pony. And it literally says that the ponies hated each other, even though the series already did that and solved it...  and how did Sunny turn into a alicorn so quickly? It's just a bad storyline... and it ruined my childhood. It should have been the Mane 6.\n",

      "Rating: 1.5\n",
      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "Review 2: More admirable than it is artistically satisfying, most of the credit I give to Sankofa is due to the attempt to convey a compelling story about the events leading up to an eventual plantation uprising during the times of slavery, and to a certain extent it succeeds in doing so, as it's pretty difficult to watch at times in its uncompromising violence. Though the non existent budget they had to work with shows, and the film could have used a firm editing hand as there's not enough content to justify more than two hours in length, it's not an experience that's completely tarnished.\n",

      "Review 3: I lost my husband suddenly and tragically a little over a year ago. I have been a lot like Lily's character. I appreciate that the movie brought out the fact that the main characters were already the way they were when faced with the loss of their child. I also liked that they didn't say there were \"answers\" to grief. Mental fog is a real thing too. That was one of the scariest things to deal with, especially returning to my job just one week after my husband's death. Thankfully, my errors were not as significant as some of Lily's. I liked how the vet continued to use his therapeutic skills to help his clients. So needed. I appreciated the interactions between all the different characters that showed the complexity of human experiences. It's a really good film to cause one to think, feel, and develop a heart of understanding and compassion for others.\n",

Look between the lines - there is one person who sums up the investigation of which, I dismissed too early without watching the whole show. This personality disorder (s) is more common today in society than ever before. In fact 22% of all incarcerated criminals carry this common trait. So how do children, abused children, and often not abused children, lack full development of the anterior insular (cingulate) cortex? Would you believe a strong correlation between parenting and child brain development could be the origin. I have worked in child protection and written papers on concussion related dementia. Mental illness that keeps getting buried in favor of gun control is not getting us there. This show is a fascinating case study on parenting and the results we are now just starting to realize. The show highlights the progression of this person-Billy Milligan, and how the health care system is uncertain how to diagnose and treat him. For me it is an incredible case study.\n",

It is all about the nascent Ottoman Empire, it doesn't push religion but of course, religion does play a big part. The acting is brilliant and so convincing, that you find yourself desperate to warn your hero/heroine of trouble afoot and lying awake at night thinking about...will they be safe or not?.

      "However, the film's plot, involving twins and mistaken identities, feels convoluted and lacks originality. The humor often falls flat, and the emotional moments lack depth and resonance. The pacing is uneven, with some scenes dragging while others feel rushed.\n",

We were able to observe more about the relationship between Otis and Maeve since they are finally together but they can't because of other people with whom they are also related. I found the trip different but not so bad, it was an escape to the daily and it worked for them but I didn't like what happened with Rahim, a good character and they waste it like that? That event was more than unnecessary, it was disgusting but it looks very good (in some way) with the series.

E neste exato momento o mestre Shaolin Wong Jack Man (Yu Xia). Aqui Bruce parece até meio vilão, pois vai atrás de Wong sempre para lutar contra ele. Neste paralelo temos um dos alunos de Bruce que acaba se envolvendo com uma das escravas da Triade. Com boas cenas de lutas e coreografia de Philip Ng e Yu Xia dão ao filme uma ótima pitada de ação. E o encontro deles leva a um empate. Até que ao final temos a luta contra a Triade. Conhecer mais a historia de Bruce é muito legal e sentir seu ímpeto, que fez quem ele é. E o ator Philip representou bem seu papel, lembrando aquela arrogância que só Bruce havia. Mas sinto que faltou algo para que o filme pegasse na veia. Uma pena.\n",

When I heard this book would be getting a film eventually, I had so many incredible ideas and visions. This movie is none of the things I wanted or imagined. What could have been an epic live action tale of a deadly dragon conqueror and the glorious bond between a silver dragon and a human boy was squandered by this childrens film. This had great potential. Potential to become one of the most epic dragon tales of all of cinema history, battling even Dragon Heart, but it fell short in almost every way. A true disappointment.\n",

The gore, while it's there, is mostly poor cgi garbage that pretty much ruins any intensity the film builds up and to make it worse the \"curse\" seems to wreak more of a native american feel than an aboriginal one.

I have studied and followed Malcolm X by means of literature, interviews and his public speeches. Unfortunately, the extent to which he was betrayed by the Nation of Islam was only narrowly discussed until now. Moreover, prior to this documentary, I had no knowledge of his experience with Muhammad Ali. The magnitude of betrayal and persecution Malcolm X endured serves as a testament to the calling on his life. Despite the attempts at character assassination and the harsh persecution by the people closest to him, Malcolm X prevailed as a prominent leader in the Civil Rights movement.  While I did not agree with all of his philosophical views, I am grateful for his contributions to the Civil Rights movement.\n",

      "Review 2: Very political in the way it promotes individual charity over shared responsibility thus making Americas billionaire class so absurdly wealthy at the expense of those in need. Also personally I would feel bad knowing my gender or skin color played any role in my selection to the mission in the name of diversity. It is very clear that this is a PR project designed to promote corporate space exploitation over tax funded national space projects which would benefit all in the name of science. Watching this is a reminder that America has more extreme wealth and simultaneous poverty than the rest of the world\n",

      "Review 1: Unsung heroes with a noble mission tend to be obscured beneath the headlines, but their influences collectively build a worthwhile story. This film, with a reasonably explanatory title, adds onto the sensitively distraught narrative surrounding 9/11 with a finalizing question that pushes the thematic dedication with humane convictions empathetically written, during the financial complication as an unseen, unconsidered factor that was thrillingly treaded. At the end, it celebrates in memory after reactive, argumentative performances in concurrently compromising a line within respective objectivities, thus a positionally polished conclusion to the devastated impacts, despite the delivered pacing.

I would rather use the blunt end of spoon to surgically insert a new brain into myself, a new brain that hadn't seen this film so that I may live a life free of this film, a film that can only be describe as my thirteenth reason why.  Please do avoid this film if you have the option, literally anything else I have seen as offered a more interesting plot, more exciting characters, and for a fashion designer, the outfits can only be described as a poor use of someone's time, the only outfit that displayed fanny's character would be the one at the start of the film, and maybe the ball scene if you squint.  I have seen indie films with better use of symbolism for a characters fashion.  In fact the only thing that could be a worse use of time then watching this movie would be to sit here and think about this film, I won't to forget this film and move on with my life.\n",

When sitting at the table before and during the spill scene, John was wearing his green Army shirt with shoulder epaulets.  The E-6 Staff Sergeant rank insignia was being worn backwards, or in reverse on those epaulets.  A major faux pas if being viewed by former or active military personnel.  I’m a 28 year U.S. Air Force veteran but we are all familiar with each services rank insignia.\n",

      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "Review 2: Dear John cranks up the melodrama in true Nicholas Sparks fashion, but it’s tough to ignore the solid performances at its core. Channing Tatum and Amanda Seyfried have this undeniable chemistry that sells the whirlwind romance, even when the plot feels like a well-worn path. Tatum, in particular, shines as John, playing the soldier torn between duty and love. But it’s the father-son relationship that hits the hardest. The emotional goodbye to his father is just as gut-punching as his farewell to Savannah, adding layers you don’t usually expect in your typical romantic drama.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lasse Hallström brings his signature warm touch, making even the most predictable plot points feel personal. You’ve got all the classic Sparks stuff—sandy beaches, handwritten letters, and star-crossed lovers—but the real standout is how the film dives into deeper connections, showing that communication goes beyond just words. The cinematography? Gorgeous. While the movie doesn’t exactly reinvent the wheel, it knows its audience and delivers on that sweet, emotional tension.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yeah, it’s sentimental and predictable, but that’s also kind of the point, right? If you’re looking for an old-school tearjerker with a stunning cast and beautiful backdrops, Dear John does what it’s supposed to. It’s simple, heartfelt, and totally designed to yank at those heartstrings—so, maybe stock up on tissues before you hit play.\n",

And it takes times to build meaningful characters AND a meaningful message together which many forget to do or really have trouble. Powerhouse acting across the board especially by the kids which is the best asset here. Not one of their stories blends in or is forgettable, repetitive, or ever does it feel over the top. It feels so geniunely sincere and real and carries this through some of the jumpiness of bouncing between each stories throughout the year. The music is really good too althought the 90's rap and cinematic numbers don't merge that well together as a whole. The scenes themselves are so intense and impactful. Everyone should give this a try once.\n",

Reynolds and Saarsgard were just fine and the effects were OK - if you enjoy the genre you probably won't hate it.  It was just very far fetched and even silly at times.  Green Lantern, perhaps like Aquaman, simply may not be the best superhero for live action.\n",

      "Review 3: \"Once Upon a Time in America\" is a tricky movie to review. The film had various production issues, mainly surrounding the runtime of the movie. The version now released is 3 hours 49 minutes. The theatrical release was cut down to a 2-hour version. Leone's original plan had the footage at 6 hours, planning on it to be 2 movies. It says something about the film, that I would be interested in seeing those alternate versions. But I will try not to speculate about what could have been, but instead focus on what we got here, the 229-minute version. And what we have here... is a mixed bag.\n",
      "\n",
      "Starting with the positives, the music by Ennio Morricone is, shock, really really good. The soundtrack is able to capture a specific melancholy reminiscing feeling that only Morricone and Beatles songs can do.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, when the movie focuses on the 4 gangsters using their street smarts to outdo the law and rivals it leads to some very creative and clever scenes. The solutions rely less on money and manpower, but more on simple ingenuity.\n",
      "\n",
      "It might be obvious, given the reputation of those involved, but it’s worth mentioning. The actors all do a great job. De Niro feels like he was born to play a gangster. James Woods has a lot of emotional explosions that he has to sell, and he delivers on these big reactions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now it is time for the negative side. I will concede, some of these are personal gripes, but this is my review, so these are my problems. This movie has a lot of scenes that are just hard to watch. The world is unpleasant. And I get it, the director is not glamorizing the gangster life. The feeling of regret permeates the story. That doesn't mean I want to see a sexual assault. I won't go into all the grizzly details; you can check the parental guide if you want to know.\n",
      "\n",
      "About the first 100 minutes focuses on De Niro and the gang as 12 year old kids. This whole section of the movie is dull. And at some points I feel like I should be on some sort of watchlist for looking at this stuff. The section of the movie that’s \"GoodFella Babies\" is not what I'm looking for.\n",
      "\n",
      "Likewise, the section of the movie that has old man De Niro, is overly long. Once again, I get why they needed to frame the story in this way. But every time they cut to him reminiscing, any momentum is killed, and it just an old man wandering around.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, there is a lot of good parts in the film. You just have to sit through a lot of middling stuff and some filth in order to get to it. Some may disagree, but that's what is great about America, you are free to have your own opinion.\n",

And the young love in this film is so unromantic there’s no chemistry and I did not ship anyone. In the end it’s best if everyone died so that the movie could have been over sooner the plot is so inconsistent why does the disaster begin to early and not only that but the ship doesn’t even sink to the bottom until the very end when it is capsized it would sink right away congratulations you have just failed logic. Another thing that made me lose my mind with the awfulness of this horrendous mess of a film was a pointless appearance of a character by the name lucky Larry some douchebag that resembles an idiotic version of Ethan hawke and despite the fact his nickname is lucky Larry he isn’t lucky at all as. He fails to cross the line to the other side and is crushed by some kind of engine that comes out of now where after making knocking sounds that don’t fit for how it would fall off the ceiling. The effects look like they filmed them on a thousand dollar budget. And the directing and writing are so incompetent that it almost matched Ed wood Z grade movie level bad. This is one of those remakes that feels like it was made by assylum it was more like a rip off of Poseidon than an actual remake of it every single death scene in it was so laughably boring and lifeless I didn’t care about anyone. I don’t know who this was made for or who would find it entertaining when everything that happens is so confusing and inconsistent that it’s hard to tell what was the meaning of it like maybe there wasn’t any. This was one of the worst remakes of the 2000s that should have been straight to dvd it didn’t even look fit for a theatrical release that’s how bad it is beyond horrendous is the best way to describe it 1/10\n",

      "Review 2: Based on a true story this emotional albeit somewhat sappy movie touched on what many, including yours truly, find a important issue in society today, the homelessness problem. Movie never really got that deep yet it did delve into how society looks at homelessness which still is a contentious issue. Greg Kinnear plays his stereotype character and does well in his swim lane. Renee Zellweger attempts to step out of her goofy roles to play a somewhat serious character and holds her own but doesn't stand out. Djimon Hounsou does better than average as Denver, his voice and cadence seems spot on. One could argue that there is a feeling of racism and typical black stereotype that maybe the movie could have done without, however not knowing the real Denver, it could have just been an accurate representation of the real person. I was worried it would get too preachy as most Pure Flix movies tend to be but this one touched on God and religion but skipped through it like a rock on a pond. Worth a watch.\n",

In The Line of Fire is a psychological thriller as much as a potboiler boiler-plate assassination/chase/cat and mouse hunt flick.

      "\n",
      "Firstly about the cast, I mean Ritesh Deshmukh has great acting skills. This movie was a dud especially the first half but yeah its only Ritesh's acting that was commendable. Tusshar Kapoor, well he was really good only in Golmaal but in this movie his over acting is evident. Actually it would've been better if he had his mouth shut in this movie too. The two female leads were just okay. Mr. Anupam Kher, the versatile and the brilliant actor (whenever his name comes across I remember \"A Wednesday\" and many more amazing movies he's been a part of) was just wasted. He was brilliant in Kya Kool Hai Hum though.\n",
      "\n",
      "Secondly about the direction and the story, I just felt like pulling my hair! I mean for instance in a scene Tushhar Kappor and Ritesh Deshmukh are shown at \"La Whore Dhaba\" (actually Lahore Dhaba) where they ask for Cappuccino's and obviously the cook at the Dhaba exclaims \"Yeh Cappuccino Kya Hai?\" that's where the director adds the song \" Hum Toh Hai Cappuccino\"!\n",
      "\n",
      "Vishal Dadlani sings \"Dil Garden Garden\" really well. Another decent song is Hum Toh Hai Cappuccino. That's it other than these two songs, there's really nothing in the movie at all. \n",
      "\n",
      "Good, really funny jokes are few and just scattered and distant. Most of the jokes are really lame. Comedy scenes are really rare.\n",

      "Review 1: There are a handful of movies in which an actor or actress completely owns every second they are on the screen and gives a performance that makes the movie worth watching. When it comes to somewhat recent Bollywood movies, Vidya Balan's lead performance in \"The Dirty Picture\" is one of those moments. This movie isn't perfect in terms of its storytelling as it does have a second half that isn't as well put together as the first, but I still really liked the movie because the acting was so top-notch. The movie also makes an interesting statement comparing movies that are designed to be a commercial success as opposed to movies that are a critical success. Despite the profound statements the movie tries to make, they are a bit held back because some of the supporting characters felt a bit cartoonish at times and it took me out of the movie here and there. Nonetheless, this is still a very memorable movie because Vidya Balan is just so good in it and her commitment to the role really shows throughout the movie.\n",

Eden's Zero is one of my favorites of his, and due to that I have kept up with the manga. This created even more excitement for the anime. The first season is a lot like One Piece's first season in terms of pacing and importance. It's a lot of set up for the later seasons and the world building, while also staying entertaining and fun to watch. It does take a bit to get into, though it took me considerably less time to get into Edens Zero than it did for me to get into One Piece. I highly recomend it, though I wouldn't watch it as a first anime, as later in the series it does get very very brutal.\n",

Ironically, probably one of the biggest reasons he rose to such fame and notoriety was directly due to Oprah Winfrey's platform and machine. And yet they only give that less than 10 seconds in the first episode.  Shame on the film makers for not giving that the weight it deserved. If you followed this case at all back in the early part of 2013 and beyond, there was not much new information or revelations from the work done on this series.  I found most of the interviews and more notably the translations of those interviews poorly done. If you know nothing about John of God, you might find it interesting.

He's not particularly charismatic or clever. He just recognizes the willingness of people to be conned and/or to stay silent while they witness the crimes.

And after viewing the documentary, you have to ask yourself - just who was giving him any power at all?  Was it God or was it Satan?   Just as members of the catholic church have been accused of sexual abuse over many years, it is a travesty to see any person or group use God as a front - and then perform acts such as these - any church or person who is guilty of such a heinous act will answer to God one day - do not be deceived.  If women had come forward very early on, João could have been stopped a LOT SOONER. The catholic church is a man-made creation - Christ established Christ' church.  There is no catholic church.  The catholic church is an aberration, a mutation of Christ' church, just as João is a heresy of the Christian faith.  The information in this documentary is very valuable - lesson learned to all people - if you experience anything like this - REPORT IT IMMEDIATELY.\n",

Stupid format which won't allow much time for creativity. Usually really funny comics like Tanmay, Rohan, Kenny, kaniz etc seemed like they gave up on comedy. And the frequent and unnecessary misogynistic curses in hindi just makes it awkward. Even the team names are shitty. Very rarely a good or avg joke pops up that will make one laugh for a second and then again endless shitty jokes. A lot of time in the show is wasted on voting. By 4th episode Tanmay and Rohan look visibly sad.\n",

      "Review 2: Sweet Girl - 4/10. Brian Andrew Mendoza debuts with a clunky whimper of an action film. Starring Jason Momoa and Isabela Merced, who happen to be the only good things about the movie, star as a father and daughter team who seek out to get justice against a pharmaceutical company. Along the way, they dive deep into a corrupt system, finding out evil truths. What could have been an interesting film turns out to be a highly missed opportunity. And with an unbelievable (in a bad way) plot twist, the movie veers towards cliche and tried and tired tropes. Spoilers for anyone who will want to see the film, but the plot twist makes for a ridiculous reveal. If the story had revolved around the daughter from the beginning, this might have ended up being an interesting film. However, you get invested in the father, and it all goes down the drain with that twist. Its like baking a birthday cake and having it turn out to be a pumpkin pie. You expect one thing and you get something else in return. The film has great acting from the lead duo, who help bring the film out of gutter with convincing performances. The action is somewhat decent, though a little hard to see due to shoddy camera work. All in all, another failed star vehicle from Netflix.\n",

      "Review 1: Like Crazy feels like you are on a series of dreamy dates with Felicity Jones and Anton Yelchin.\n",
      "\n",
      "Director Drake Doremus’ indie romance drama Like Crazy (2011) is adorable, romantic, heartwarming, devastating, and creative. Doremus’ intimate direction is enthralling as it feels like we’re in the room with these characters’ exchange students throughout their tumultuous long-distance relationship. It was based on Doremus’ real life long-distance relationship with Desiree Pappenscheller as they went back and forth between London and Los Angeles. Like Crazy is Felicity Jones getting her own depressing film equivalent of Blue Valentine or Manchester by the Sea. I hope new viewers give Like Crazy a chance as it is easily one of the greatest indie films I have ever had the pleasure of watching.\n",
      "\n",
      "It’s insane to me that Like Crazy was written as an outline of 50 pages by writers Ben York Jones and Drake Doremus, then Felicity Jones and Anton Yelchin improvised almost all of the actual dialogue in the film. They filmed Like Crazy in just four weeks and only for a small budget of $250,000. What a brilliant display of innovative acting and raw creative artistry. I appreciate Felicity and Anton going through the awkwardness of asking someone out, the intrigue of getting to know someone, the joy of having fun with the person you care about, the nervousness from getting serious about marriage, the frustration with immigration visas, the yearning ache of being separated from your love, the anger and jealous in a tumultuous relationship, to the gradual decline of love once you’ve both grown apart. Watching this tender love fall to pieces is truly devastating to me. I was tearing up seeing their love fade. Once Felicity’s wrist bracelet saying “Patience” breaks, I knew it was really over.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anton Yelchin is outstanding as the sensitive furniture designer Jacob Helm. Yelchin is handsome, funny, sweet, furious, tender, sensitive, jealous, caring, uncertain, and dejected as the romantic hero Jacob Helm. I miss Anton Yelchin so much and it makes me cry seeing him so full of life as Jacob. He’s really phenomenal in Like Crazy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Felicity Jones is excellent as the poetic writer and blogging editor Anna Gardner. Jones is gorgeous and delicate as she displays all of Anna’s euphoria and despair. Jones is devastating as we get to know her playful and thoughtful romantic heroine Anna, who opens up her vulnerable heart to this young man. Seeing her get insecure in their love and dealing with the horrifying injustices with the travel visas, and how this negatively affects their enjoyment together broke me. I found her lovable and realistic as she depicts how a loving long-distance relationship can wither away in time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Felicity Jones is one of my all time favorite actresses since seeing her in The Theory of Everything, Rogue One, On the Basis of Sex, and now Like Crazy. This has to be her absolute greatest performance as a dramatic actress. She should have gotten an Oscar for this dazzling acting.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jennifer Lawrence is sympathetic as Yelchin’s later girlfriend Samantha, who is his on and off again girlfriend. Lawrence is very subtle as she hurts inside that Yelchin’s Jacob is not picking her over his overseas girlfriend. Charlie Bewley is great as Felicity’s later boyfriend, the controlling Simon, with his own ideas for her life.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alex Kingston’s bubbly mother Jackie Gardner and Oliver Muirhead’s warm, but stern father Bernard Gardner are wonderful as Felicity’s loving and friendly parents. Chris Messina apparently appears as Mike Appletree, but I don’t recall which friend he played. Finola Hughes is friendly as Felicity’s lady boss Liz.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cinematographer John Guleserian keeps the camera near the cast in very intimate close-ups. I love the sweeping camera motions as much as the pretty close-up shots of Felicity’s hurting eyes or Anton’s forlorn head gazing off to the side. Composer Dustin O'Halloran’s gentle piano film score is mesmerizing with a very romantic main theme. I was captivated by the music in Like Crazy. Paul Simon, M83, Stars, The Mary Onettes, and Figurine also get great songs for the soft soundtrack.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, I adored Like Crazy for Felicity Jones and Anton Yelchin’s vulnerable acting performances that are fully improvised in this indie darling romance drama. In 90 minutes, your heart will shatter.\n",

      "----------------------------------------\n",

I also used to think Maya-Camille was so sweet, but she annoys me so much now to the point that I almost don't want to watch the show anymore. If the host has the fakest, most annoyingly cheerful personality, then MC is the jealous Debbie downer who passively aggressively complains the entire time and thinks that her skills are way better than they actually are. The other three bakers make a great team, though, and are super cute for the show. The show wouldn't be worth watching if it wasn't for them.\n",

      "Review 1: Navarasa - 9/10. The much hyped and anticipated anthology series Navarasa is finally here, and it has created a little bit of a division in reviews. Either people love it or hate it. I fall in the love it crowd. Yes, there are some shorts that don't hit the bullseye in terms of effect, but the overall package and the better shorts makes this anthology series a superb production. Curated and produced by Mani Ratnam and Jayendra Panchapakesan, the films explore the 9 emotions with a variety of story. The stories take place in different settings and different situations, and each one has been made with care. For online content, this is the best shot anthology series so far in tamil. The way the various cinematographers have captured their stories is amazing to see. They all seem to be having fun with the lens, really elevating the emotional quotient of the stories. Each director throws their own spin on the stories. Not all of shorts are equal in quality though, but when marathoning them all together you feel the effect very well. The top shorts are definitely the Karthick Naren, Gautham Vasudev Menon, Rathindran R. Prasad, Arvind Swamy, and Karthik Subbaraj shorts. Each one really captures the emotion of the tale really well. The other shorts are decent, but they feel like they're missing something here and there. I think the reason people don't like the series is maybe because people are watching an episode and watching another one later on. When you watch the films together, you get an understanding as to what the overall product is. To me, I liked the notion of allowing these amazing performers to explore the dramatic side of the stories. The acting is top notch because theres so much to explore in each emotion. A great watch overall and a full package of entertainment!\n",

Even with Caine, Chamberlain, and Ross the film was just….. not that good lol. Honestly though you can’t hate this movie with a passion, for one thing the cinematography was surprisingly competent.  Like genuinely in a lot of scenes I found myself thinking “damn, that looks good”. The movie also had no chill, they were killing off literally everyone. Even the children, which is something you don’t see too much in modern cinema. So kind of a nice change of pace. I also really like the ending, I kind of hate endings that are all happy or whatever. Either way, avoid this one unless you don’t want to, it’s up to you I guess. Don’t let online reviews dictate whether or not you like a movie. 1.5/5 stars funny little horror movie here, with some pretty crazy stuff. (Also Jerry Goldsmith went crazy on that end title theme, so crazy in fact that it was later used in the Alien movies. Nice that it found new life in a completely different horror film.)\n",

      "Review 2: Lin-Manuel Miranda had a busy year in 2021. Along with directing a Best Picture nominee in \"Tick...Tick...Boom!\" he provided the music for two animated movies. One of these was \"Encanto\" which went on to win \"Best Animated Picture\" as the Oscars. The animated film was this one, \"Vivo\". One advantage this film has over \"Encanto\" is that Lin actually does the singing in this film. Miranda is such a unique talent, no one can write songs the way he does, and no one can perform them the way he does. Not only is he great singer, he is a great voice actor as well. There are so many jokes in this movie that are sold by his delivery. He provides a lot of pained screams that are comedy gold.\n",

      "The story ebbs and flows in quality. The opening 30 minutes and ending 30 minutes are very good. They hit all the emotional beats just right and move characters forward in a believable way. I even enjoy the twist they do on the kids' buddy road trip formula. Typically, there are two characters that don't get along and they gripe the whole time. That happens here as well, but since one character can't understand the other, they are able to be as brutally mean as they like without it offending the other. They just naively go along like they are the best of friends, and it leads to some funny jokes.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is just that pesky middle 30 minutes that feels like a series of plot contrivances in order to make the movie happen. There are plenty of ways to fix the problem in a quick and painless way, but to make the story last for 94 minutes, needless complications arise. It is all basic animated movie stuff, and there are some funny jokes interlaced throughout, but it doesn't rise to the quality of its opening or closing.\n",

The heroine, the nurse Barb and Dr Hamid deliver very strong performances. I have some reservations about Will that looks to me too much like a pretty boy, but I have to admit that I am not, nor have ever been an adolescent girl. Overall, a story about teens afflicted with a life threatening condition inescapably invites melodrama and then the function of the filmmaker is to keep things under control. Some elements of the story and some songs of the soundtrack were a little too much.\n",

And while there were plenty of bad ones, tons and tons of bad ones, this one is one of the better ones. I liked both leads. I think they did a good job presenting how high schools kids with this condition would act and respond with this condition. The ending did not pull punches but seemed to fit and maybe not as forced as some even if I kind of saw it coming a mile away. This does not tread new and original ground but is competent at what it does. It is a non-offensive sick kid rom-com if that is what you are looking for.\n",

The film portrays the relationship between two young people with cystic fibrosis, offering an approach to the disease without descending into excessive melodrama. Despite some predictable moments, the film carries a sincerity, especially when it focuses on the emotions and challenges the characters face. The plot could have been deeper, but the connection between the two leads and the way the film addresses health issues makes it an engaging experience.\n",

      "Review 3: Freedomland wastes a tasty pairing of Moore and Jackson on a film littered with so many strange, amateurish errors that one wondered who allowed this mess to occur. For goodness sake, Joe Roth's last directing credit before this was Christmas with the Kranks! The editing in some sections is some of the worst that I have seen in any film. Fade transitions showing the age of the film and at least one egregious slow-motion shot, along with a few random melodramatic sound effects, contribute to a notion that this editor should be allowed nowhere near a film studio again without a serious reappraisal. For goodness sake, he worked on Mission: Impossible? What went wrong?! The most climactic scenes are ruined by their overlong dialogue failing to strike any serious chords of originality. Moore gives her all and almost sells it, but too many of the other characters introduce threads and then fail to elaborate upon them in a manner almost matching The Room in ineptitude. The generous two stars, given the criticism so far, remain because Jackson works dependably well and some of the bleakness of the Price's script and its outlook on racial tensions and police brutality land a few hefty blows suggesting the impossibility of underprivileged communities to ever reach peace with governing forces or the police. After this, though, especially with the unsatisfying and frankly asinine central conflict of child kidnapping, praise runs thin.\n",

Paul Thomas Anderson has carved a path in the history of cinema that few before him can claim to have carved. He is a genius with pen and pad just as he is a visual genius with a camera and crew. A visionary. \n",
      "\n",
      "What he did along with this brilliant ensemble cast is unforgettable. So many beautiful performances in this one. The multilayered performance by Tom Cruise, his career best in my opinion. The tender, heart touching performance by Philip Seymour Hoffman. William H. Macy gives one of his career best performances. Melora Walters gives a real standout performance. The sincere, brilliant performance by John C. Reilly. Philip Baker Hall gives one of my favorite performances in any film by any actor. Jason Robard gives such a memorable performance while literally on his deathbed. He wasn't just playing a dying man, he was one. Julianne Moore gives an outstanding, emotional performance. Two thumbs up for Henry Gibson. April Grace gives a stunning performance when her character confronts and exposes Frank T.J. Mackey. I could go on and on.\n",

      "The soundtrack is awesome. The camera work is magnificent. The tracking shot at around the 43 minute mark is quite impressive. The rain, the elevator and round and round it went. There are several of those shots and they are all amazing. \n",
      "\n",
      "My one and only issue that I have with Magnolia is the overuse of Exodus 8:2. Yes, we see 8s and 2s all over the film, which are brilliant little foreshadowing Easter eggs. However, when a man is the audience literally has \"Exodus 8:2 on a sign and when we see it again on the sign by the street, that to me is a little too convenient. Of course, it is not impossible, but I personally deem it to be improbable. I mean, it's not like Exodus 8:2 is a common, uplifting Bible verse like John 3:16 or Phil 4:13. I could certainly understand seeing those verses listed in any number of places. Why Exodus 8:2, other than the foreshadowing of what's to come? This is ultimately a minor detail, but once you see it, you can't unsee it. \n",

      "If not for this one, minor flaw, I would definitely consider Magnolia a masterpiece. Even with my harsh penalization, I still give the film a strong 96, near masterpiece score.

      "Review 2: Okay… I came into to this movie with no knowledge of anything at all. I walked out, confused and confuzzled about what I just saw. First of all, the writers did some weird stuff. Starting with the foreshadowing; there is literally so much of it in this movie. And I do applaud the writers for this. It’s just they probably should have focused more on the plot and music more. Speaking of the music… I was not shocked to find that this 2000s movie did not have the best soundtrack in the books, but it also just also didn’t fit the tone of the movie. If you want a “comedy” that makes you question how astronauts actually are and I guess dive deep into characters for one split sec—basically no character development in this entire dang movie— then it is for you. I just felt weird and confused in the worst way. But that’s just my general opinion.\n",

She knew their parents, but never even saw a picture of this man who was his mom's golden child??? She was also still crying about Jason a year after he left her, but she never stalked him on social to see that he was in a relationship/engaged again? We know he had social media as it was pointed out because of her best friends algorithm with the ads thing. Then there's the fact that she most definitely was not a girls girl as she was sneaking around meeting Jason. And his wishy washy feelings, then acting like he married his true love pissed me tf off. He def settled. And her singing their song at his wedding was like a \"you've gotta be kidding me\" moment. There's no way that wouldn't have hurt either of them. Then she jumps off the stage to kiss his brother? Omggggg. It was only the night before that Jason was trying to meet with her, if this was a true story, he probably would have lost his mind seeing that. \n",

Would have liked to have seen Anderson kept in the show longer because his character was one of the most interesting. Liked that the series was based on Beau Smith's graphic novels. Thought the action was good but the romances were way overplayed.\n",

      "Review 2: This should'nt be as bad as it is. There are some nice shots in this, Robert Shaw is half decent, and the premise of an underwater treasure hunt sounds like some great starting pieces for a underwater blockbuster. The death blow to this is the HORRIFC pacing. There is no suspense, tension, drama, or thrills of ANY KIND AT ALL. It just prods along alternating between boring plot expose and long dragged out underwater scenes. And I mean LONG and DRAGGED out. One of the biggest reasons the editing is terrible as well. Once you've seen one of the underwater scenes which at first is pretty cool actually, you've seen them all. They all look the same and if you rearranged them I truly would'nt be able to tell the difference. There is SOME attempt at action in this but there over in a second, done underwater and done very slowly, or are just lacking any specticle factor. It's a major reason why the cinematography isn't good because I swear half this movie is underwater or on the water and it all looks the same. The on land scenes look better and the framing, lighting, and all is good in those but it's just boring plot expose 75% of the time. One other culprit here is the terribly boring music. It's not used enough and when it is, it is so generic and forgettable it somehow makes the scene even MORE boring. The acting is probably the best thing here and is just ok. No one really has any character to them. The bad voodoo guys are forgettable and the couple really don't have much chemistry. This needed to take a lesson from Thunderball and Jaws, two blockbusters that did water scenes MUCH better overall. So it's not that they didn't know how to do it at this point. So that begs the question what the heck happened here. And how did they screw up the pacing THIS badly especially for a summer blockbuster. Underwater scenes can be great visual storytelling moments when done right to compensate for the slowness especially with a great soundtrack. I seriously can't recommend this to anyone. Skip This. It's insane how boring and dragged out this feels despite generally a simple enough plot to follow.\n",

      "Review 1: Esta es una verdadera obra de arte, nos muestra este México de los 50's que era gobernado únicamente por el PRI, por el Circulo Negro, pero nos muestra la cruda realidad de México, los mexicanos y los políticos, vemos como Juan Vargas, priista, es mandado a un pueblito en medio de la nada, porque el anterior Presidente Municipal había muerto, que en realidad lo mataron, pero aquí vemos como este nuevo Presidente Municipal desde un inicio lo que quería era llevar la modernidad y justicia a San Pedro de los Saguaros, pero Juan se da cuenta que iba a ser difícil hacer este cambio y que la misma población de la localidad no aporta en nada para hacer este cambio y en vez de cambiar las cosas y llevar la modernidad y justicia termina corrompido como un político más, corrupto y con abuso de poder, pero lo que yo considero importante es como en esta película nos muestra la realidad o las dos caras de la moneda, ya que vemos que Juan (Presidente Municipal) si tenía la intención de hacer las cosas bien, incluso pide ayuda y consejo a ciudadanos y otros políticos pero se da cuenta que sin la corrupción es imposible gobernar en México, puede que solo sea una película, pero esta muestra la realidad de México y de los mexicanos, al final de cuentas un político no es un ser extraño de la raza humana o que llego por arte de magia a la tierra, un político crece rodeado de la sociedad que va a gobernar y obvio aprende de ahí y cuando llega al poder se da cuenta que por medio de corrupción es la única forma en la que se puede gobernar México. La historia tiene buena narrativa, todos los personajes están bien desarrollados, la escenografía es adecuada al contexto de la película y tiene una trama que le interesa a los mexicanos, porque claro, al mexicano le da risa las desgracias y más si son propias.\n",
      "Lo que podemos concluir es que gracias al PRI tenemos estabilidad institucional, si no hubiera existido el PRI, ahorita todos estamos viviendo entre revolucionaros y caudillos como en 1880 o como en tiempos de la Revolución, ya que vemos que Don Porfirio Díaz nos trajo estabilidad, la estabilidad que estaban deseando y pidiendo a gritos los mexicanos y México, pero al final esta larga duración en el poder no les pareció a todos y solo que se enojaban de este modelo se rebelaron contra el presidente Porfirio, al final ninguno de los tres que se rebelaron contra Porfirio ganó, de hecho eso esta explicado en el primer párrafo de la actual constitución de México y un par de gobiernos y presidentes después vemos como el PNR llego a darle a México y a los mexicanos lo que necesitaban, una estabilidad institucional que fuera regida como monarquía, explicado en el libro El Círculo Negro de Antonio Velasco Piña.\n",

      "Review 1: Have you ever wanted to watch Twilight, but without any interesting powers, none of the complex lore behind the vampires and werewolves, and pretty much completely set in nearly only two settings? Me neither. This is probably my least favorite of the Twilight Saga and it was absolutely laughably bad. The only parts I liked were the moments that were so bad they were good, but the whole movie felt very unnecessary and could have bit shortened to help add a new dynamic to part two completely. But instead, they seemed to want to focus on the most boring and weakest aspects of the franchise in this one and also ended it off in the worst way possible by massacring Jacob’s character and leaving it off on a really obvious cliffhanger. Twilight is usually so bad it is good, but this one was simply bad sometimes.\n",

      "Review 3: \"Breaking Dawn Part 1\" is a much higher stakes film in the Twilight Saga compared to the previous films. I was literally on the edge of my seat, fearing the well-being of the characters. The first half dragged, but I appreciated that a majority of the scenes gave the audience some needed \"happy\" and \"blissful\" vibes. The last 30 minute sequence was definitely a rollercoaster ride where I was at the edge of my seat. Bella's character felt real with everything that she was going through, the cinematography was beautiful and sucked you into the story. Compared to \"New Moon\" and \"Eclipse\", this film kept me in it.\n",

      "Review 1: Twilight finally ends with this movie and, surprisingly, it wasn’t as bad as I thought it would be. The plot was pretty straightforward and had a little zest to it by confirming answers to many questions and adding a flavor to the cast with very good actors. The movie is not very visually stunning, in fact, Renesmee is horrifying to look at for 99% of her screentime. Jacob’s character continues to be massacred until there is nothing left of him and Edward and Bella is glorified for being absolutely horrible people for most of these movies. The movie actually handles its plot well and the acting is halfway decent, not to mention that I didn’t not like the plot twist at the end. Yes, it could have definitely been a better movie and had a better ending especially, but it wasn’t horribly by any means.\n",

This is a perfect example of what happens when there is too much money thrown into a movie for actors, and the story is just pieced together from other movies and the director is just stealing from other successful directors for a style that they hope will sell.

      "Review 1: Movie,  is a quasi Jules Et Jim like story with tanned and toned  Barbara Hershey,  Richard Thomas,  Bruce Davison and a seagull,   cavorting in the sand and surf.  Hershey is very attractive ,  but she's a manipulative psycho, and the two guys are idiots to fall for her.   Movie is shot in super fuzzy vision.   Movie just observes their behavoir, and offers no judgment.  I guess that was the point,  but I really didnt care.\n",

      "Review 2: Other than to catch performances from Barbara Hershey, Richard Thomas, and Bruce Davison from early in their careers, there's no reason to waste any time on Last Summer.  The plot is as threadbare as one could imagine – three teens spend their summer at the beach getting high, drinking beer, engaging in inane conversations, and laughing hysterically for no apparent reason, all leading to an ugly final scene that comes out of nowhere.  The acting is bad, the writing is significantly worse, and, to top it off, the whole thing looks as though it has been shot through a screen door or cheesecloth.  Yeah, there are worse movies out there, but few are as consistently irritating as Last Summer.\n",

      "Review 2: This show is utterly mesmerizing; it draws you in and makes you yearn to be part of this charming small town. Much like the setting of Virgin River, it gives off a vibe that once you arrive, you won’t want to leave. The emotional connection it fosters is truly remarkable.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mel is perfectly cast in her role, showcasing exceptional character development that resonates throughout the series. It’s a delight to see Annette O'Toole as Hope again. While her character may be a bit irritating, that’s exactly the point—she fits seamlessly into the ensemble. Even if you’re unfamiliar with some of the cast, you can’t help but feel a desire to know them and to be included in their close-knit community.\n",
      "\n",
      "Characters like Vernon and Jack may leave you uncertain about your feelings toward them, but as the story unfolds, you begin to empathize with their journeys. Preacher, along with the rest of the cast, delivers phenomenal performances that enhance the overall experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "I wholeheartedly recommend diving into Virgin River—you won’t regret it. This series captures your attention from the very start, especially during the thrilling moments of the first season, making you feel fully engaged with the characters and their lives.\n",
      "\n",
      "The second season continues to captivate, building on the foundation laid in the first and introducing new faces, like Preacher, who steps into a more significant role. The drama, tension, and unexpected twists will leave you eager to learn more about these characters and what lies ahead.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, the third season falls short, feeling somewhat lackluster and confusing. It left me questioning whether the series could regain its momentum, as the storylines seemed stagnant and disconnected, leading me to believe it might be the end.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fortunately, season four reignites the spark, pulling you back in with captivating story arcs, and season five builds on that momentum beautifully. The growth of the characters and the re-emergence of vital storylines that were lacking in season three create a rich viewing experience, particularly with the unfolding drama surrounding Preacher and the murder in town.\n",
      "\n",
      "Season six picks up where the previous seasons left off, presenting breathtaking moments alongside some of the most heart-wrenching scenes that make you feel the impending conclusion of the series. It’s a beautifully crafted story filled with unforgettable moments, and the creators have done a remarkable job throughout the entire series. I genuinely encourage you to take the time to watch all the seasons because it truly is an extraordinary show.\n",

      "Review 2: A common theme throughout the program. These convicts grew up with no family structure, abuse and neglect. They were drug addicts, experienced assault & molestation, and uneducated. The rich get away with it or less time ( like the drug dealer, whose family won the lottery , so they could afford a decent attorney or the son who was a drug user but his father was a judge.).  I'm not excusing their criminality but I can empathize. It's easy for prosecutors and others to label these people as monsters. Unfortunately, innocent people paid the price with their lives. Tax payers pay a hefty price for death row inmates and incarceration overall. Recidivism is high. Keep these people behind bars, but implementing programs for education & enrolling them in some form of contribution to society behind bars , perhaps can help repay tax payers. (from behind bars).  Example, catching these convicts early , mental health court and drug treatment court,  some form of showing  'family, caring and love' within the prison system, which these convicts lacked, may also reduce recidivism. Drugs including alcohol is a huge problem. As a child, I grew up without parental guidance and abuse. Not as severe as these convicts. We moved around a lot. After awhile, people like this lose a sense of caring and just live with anger,  and turn to drugs to mask the pain and loss.  Very sad and so much pain for the victims.  What would these convicts be like , if they had a loving family and was not on drugs?\n",

      "Review 3: I binged watched this over the weekend.  All documentaries on old lags have an air of voyeurism and vicarious enjoyment about them but I think they present a fair image, with a little bit emotional manipulation.  It's made by Brits for the Yanks, so it's this weird hybrid of Jesus, so much Jesus, cheese and moralistic handwringing on the nature of murder and the extreme sentences handed out in the States.  They present everyone's story, from everyone's side, and you decide.  These people are not getting out of prison in a hurry so ignore the faux righteous anger from people moaning on here about it.\n",

There's bits of Macbeth and King Lear thrown into the plot, and ageing Irish beauty, Amanda Burton plays the ruthless head of a morally-bankrupt crime family.

      "Review 1: \"Orange is the New Black\" has been one of my longer television undertakings in some time. I am happy to say that this seven-season journey is well worth the time. The show does an outstanding job developing its characters and stays interesting with its flashback structure. I do think the first four seasons are easily the best, and the fourth is probably one of the best seasons of television I have seen as the storylines get darker and more serious around then. Despite tackling many intense topics, this show does often have a dark sense of humor and is frequently very funny too. I do feel the fifth and sixth seasons are a bit weaker than the rest, but I think the final season brings it all together nicely. Despite the dips in quality, I think this is a very good show all the way through and I am glad I finally got around to watching it. Overall, it is a show with important topics, completely captivating characters, and storylines that I got deeply invested in, and I would say it is among the best drama series I have seen yet.\n",

      "Our heroes are the same. All are still silly and do real nonsensical things at times. Sandy is by far my favorite though since her insanity makes the most sense to me and is the most entertaining. Pigsy I feel is misused despite developing as a chef. Monkey and Tripitaka are both basically the same as Season 1.\n",
      "The biggest difference in season 2 is that we have recurring villains the whole season unlike in season 1 where our main antagonist isn't revealed until episode 8. Gorm, General Khan, Dreglon, and Mothrax are absolutely ridiculous villains. Mothrax in particular is so pointless and dies in the most cliche way you can think of. I much prefer the one episode and done Cranius and Tsumori since they were threatening but then Monkey & Co find a way to beat them and then they are out of the way. General Khan and Dreglon's continuous fighting to be the bigger person is super dumb and is magnified by macho man Gorm. Pretty much everything General Khan does is too over the top and doesn't make sense. Dreglon acts like the dumb little brother to General Khan who always needs to prove he is better than her. Then somehow Gorm is the only one of the group who can take control. Hagfish's character was nice in episode 4 but should have stayed another lackey. If this show ever gets another season then I have no doubts Monica will be just as over the top as these villains were.\n",

More side characters than necessary with also pointless stories to waste time. Just make it 12 episodes if you have nothing to add. I didn't even care if these two were together by the end because they were THE MOST boring couple from any Kdrama I have watched.

      "Review 3: This film is amazing! The opening shot is a near 3 minute tracking shot that would rival any in the career of the great Martin Scorsese. When I think of great, long shots in well-known motion pictures, I think Orson Welles in Touch of Evil or Robert Altman in The Player or any number of shots taken by Martin Scorsese. Goodfellas and Killers of the Flower Moon come to mind, but this opening shot, stands with any of them. What a way to begin a film. Paul Thomas Anderson had a vision and seemingly exacted that vision with Boogie Nights. Mark Wahlberg was outstanding, as was the entire cast. Burt Reynolds, Julianne Moore, Don Cheadle, William H. Macy, John C. Reilly, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Philip Baker Hall & Luis Guzmán were all truly incredible. I could spend an hour discussing how great each individual performance was in this picture. The camera work is remarkable. I love the underwater shots at the pool party. The long shots always give a film that special, cinematic feel. This film is an absolute masterpiece. A perfect motion picture by Paul Thomas Anderson. I highly recommend. \n",

      "\n",
      "The movie makes the unforgivable sin of introducing Bruce Campbell, only to do nothing with his character. Throughout the movie, I kept thinking, where's Bruce? But they helped make up for it by include Ernie Hudson and Tim Curry. Tim Curry is an absolute delight, he steals every scene he is in. He is speaking in a crazy accent, rambling off nonsense and is obsessed with diamonds. He helps make this movie memorable.\n",

      "There is one character, who dies of fright in this movie. The actor that plays it, gives 110% to his performance. It is shot and delivered in such a way, that it is one of the most hilarious death scenes I've ever seen. Humor isn't what the director had in mind for the scene, but it is hilarious none the less.\n",
      "\n",
      "The rest of the movie is just your basic Jungle B-Movie affair. What makes the movie feel so hollow is by the end, I can't tell you a single thing any character learned or how any character changed. I guess Dr. Karen Ross learned her boss was a jerk, but that was painfully obvious to everyone. Everyone just went to the jungle, hi-jinx ensued, and then they leave.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think the reason it is looked back upon with such shame is because of all the wasted potential. As Bruce Campbell pointed out, on paper this movie has all the right ingredients. It has Jerry Goldsmith music, is has Stan Winston doing special effects, it has great actors and it is based on a Michael Creighton book. I'm sure producers thought after \"Jurassic Park\" was a big hit in '93, and Lion King's success in '94, they had a slam dunk with a Michael Creighton story based in Africa. But they were then disappointed once the box office rolled in, and audiences were disappointed when all they got was \"Congo\".\n",

      "\n",
      "For me, and given I watched the film a full 16 years after it's release, it was a masterpiece, ably supported by a cast who portray the helplessness and the anxiety that life sometimes puts you in, perfectly. Yet, they all have hope. The blind, vegan call center rep for a meat seller, played with the usual excellence Woody Harrelson brings to all his roles, still hopes to impress the waitress at a local eatery with his piano skills; the girl with a terminal heart condition plays a game of what if with her lover, dreaming of more time and children. And the catalyst for all their dreams: Will Smith. In a performance I would rate as more rounded than his Oscar winning gig, he portrays the role of an Uber successful MIT engineer suddenly hit hard by the reality of the aforementioned accident with heart. He demonstrates both the desire for making amends (by literally helping people with his organs), and the agony of what it means for him humanly. After all, isn't that what we all want: a human story with a touch of miracle, a dash of tragedy and an everyday hero, who starts a mission of redemption for a crime no greater than checking his phone for a couple of seconds while driving?\n",

      "Review 1: There aren't many slasher flicks with such a low body count as The Strangers. What this film did that many others didn't, was it gave us zero motive for the killers and focused mostly on building the suspense, instead of nonstop action. To an impatient viewer, this slow burn could be read as boring and the plot as pointless, but you'd be missing the point. There's plenty to enjoy here, especially Liv Tyler's performance, the skillful use of setting, and the sound work is stellar. Plus cool masks! The killers came with nothing but masks and a truck. They used their surroundings and stone cold demeanor to enact their terror. This movie added a trend or two to the home invasion subgenre of slashers. I'm not going to call it ground breaking, but it is a well deserved cult classic and worth a watch. I think it's pretty memorable.\n",

      "Review 3: The Strangers - 7/10. Bryan Bertino's terrifying \"based on a true story\" film is one of the best horror movies to come out since 2000, yet, is one that doesn't get as much due as it deserves. Following a couple who get visited by deranged murderers, the movie is a terrifying ordeal which no one wants to ever experience in real life. Its one of those #horror films that seems to understand its premise and bring its viewers in with the simple hook for a story. Its how the director shapes the viewing experience that makes for impactful viewing. Liv Tyler and Scott Speedman pretty much are the only visible characters in the entire film, and its really underrated acting on their part to carry a movie like this. You can feel the terror of them feeling like they're not alone, and you can see how uncomfortable they get as the situation becomes more and more terrifying. We've seen plenty of \"real\" horror movies, using possible situations that can happen in real life and show them on screen. But what this movie does is immerse you into the whole ordeal. Some people might find the last parts of the film too cliche or whatnot, but I find it as good pay off for the chilling lead up. A superbly underrated film that shows all you need is a good atmosphere and story to make for a good small budget horror film.\n",

The war between them works on every level and the lore and acting was very good. I enjoyed it, it won't win awards but it didn't take you out of a scene.

      "Este esperado film de Manolo Caro vuelve a abordar a la familia De la Mora en dos épocas diferentes: la actual, con los tres hermanos De la Mora y algunos personajes más y a una Virginia de la Mora ya casada (la madre) con gran parte de los personajes juveniles de la temporada 3. En ambos casos, todos se embarcan en sendas \"misiones\" a realizar en la misma casa familiar en el marco de dos fiestas.\n",

      "Entre los aciertos, Manolo Caro apela a una manera bastante virtuosa de vincular ambas líneas temporales y los personajes juveniles lucen más humanos, con más espesor que los actuales y algunas situaciones planteadas son indudablemente graciosas.

      "For fans of the series (including myself), it is always pleasant to meet again with the De la Mora family. Although the film retains and shows off some successes, (Paulina de la Mora's dialogues and an ingenious staging of its two timelines, among others) and the overall result is inferior to the series, since it cannot (nor does it want to ) reproduce its complexity, it is still agile and fun.\n",

      "This long-awaited film by Manolo Caro returns to address the De la Mora family in two different eras: the current one, with the three De la Mora brothers and some other characters and a Virginia de la Mora already married (the mother) with a large part of the youth characters of season 3. In both cases, they all undertake different \"missions\" to be carried out in the same family home in the framework of two parties.\n",

      "\n",
      "The general trend in both timelines is that of the comedy of entanglements, although the juvenile characters (especially) take up some elements of the melodrama raised in season 3, so it would be advisable for the viewer to do some review of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Among the successes, Manolo Caro appeals to a quite virtuous way of linking both timelines and the youthful characters look more human, thicker than the current ones and some situations raised are undoubtedly funny. But, without a doubt, it is Paulina de la Mora (the wonderful Cecilia Suárez) who keeps intact the magnetism of her already iconic character and the sharpness and humor of her dialogues are the best and the best of the film.\n",

Después del final de la exitosa serie con sus 3 temporadas, Manolo Caro les obsequia a sus fans una historia más de la familia De La Mora, en la que los hermanos inventan un plan para irrumpir en su antigua casa familiar y recuperar un tesoro escondido de especial importancia. Bastante graciosa y con la esencia intacta de la serie, es un gran logro considerando que su producción se llevó a cabo durante la pandemia. Si bien la historia no es particularmente memorable y está hecha exclusivamente para los fans, es bastante entretenida y proporciona un final agradable y con mucho corazón.\n",

      "My mom was watching it with me and I just Love that family!  The Kretz family. The voice over wasn't terrible either being that they talk in French and the audience is able to understand in English. Watching it and experiencing everything through them it makes you want to join their team! They're a very fun and close family that's grown their business. So We've streamed all the seasons so far and I hope they keep them coming. There's all the normal ups an downs like we all experience but the vacations and some of the homes they sell are soooo Beautiful.  That family is so very cool and Lovely to watch, I've laughed outloud so many times. Definitely check this out! That family is the exact family one would love to have as neighbors an friends.🧡\n",

      "\n",
      "Police chief was lame, boring, atrocious. Shes one dimensionnal and we already had police members with the same kind of grudge against meta. Chief also did many bad leadership decisions. She forced one of her detective to be part of the anti meta human squad when the said detective didn't wanted to be part of the squad. She mixed up her feeling and the job. \n",
      "\n",
      "Tobias Whale felt over used, he had nothing new to give us. Did the city forgot Tobias was a crime lord during season 1 and 2? also keep in mind he was considered as a dangerous meta human treat in season 3, leading him to be behind bars in season 3. Him becoming as powerful as he was during a few mounths time made no sense, we also had a similar story in arrow when Diaz controlled star city to have a seat at a big criminal group. \n",
      "\n",
      "I believe at first they planned on ending the show at season 5 but in between season 3 and 4, the actress playing Jennifer and the actor playing jefferson probably had behind the scenes conflict-drama, driving the actress toward leaving the show. Since Jennifer actress and jefferson actor were no more able to work together, they ended the show with season 4. Grave digger was still around by the end of the show. Lala was still around by the end of the show. Bigger criminal groups are still around. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now, enough negative being said, here are the reasons why it deserved an 8 out of 10. Jefferson being broken after Henderson death was amazing, giving us great acting scenes. I didnt enjoyed him being off character  that often, using his powers for revenge despite Gambi warning. JJ having social media felt dumb but teenage-like thing to do. Having a different Jennifer was interresting. Lala and the war gang was great. The new meta human killer was interresting. The season as a whole was very entertaining. Gambi was good as always. Painkiller being a good part of this season was amazing. Painkiller episodes were among the best the show aired. Despite Lynn story about drug being back and not as good as season 3 did, it was still well done and realistic, very grounded. Drug addict do lie to their families and therapists. Jennifer drug almost killed her, here again its fine since the message is well delivered, however the first time drug was a thing in the show, it was better since it was new. shakuur, henderson friend was amazing, he was a great remplacement for henderson. Tobias dying was great ending. The writting was great as any other seasons. Most of the characters all got proper closure. This was a flawed but very strong season.  Sadly, we won't see Odel dying since Painkiller spin off was canceled before being aired. If you liked black lightning, you will enjoy that season as well.\n",

Mais essa 4 temporada limpou tudo, só acho que os efeitos a partir da 3 temporada deu uma caidinha mais é bem pouco, cenas de lutas melhoraram, só acho que foi erro ter escolhido o Peankiller para uma spin off, ele evolui muito mais muito bem só que ainda soa secundário não traria público, talvez uma série da Anissa com Grace séria uma lavagem do desastre que é Batwoman com a Ryan, mais mesmo assim a série teve um fim excelente só acho que faltou crossover com The Flash, Superman e Supergirl, o Jefferson deixou suas filhas no comando, The flash têm Nora e Bart, Superman e Lois têm Jonathan e Jordan e Arrow deixou a Mia, realmente olha a organização do Arrowverse, já temos desde 2018 já temos referência de liga da justiça jovem e multiverso desde 2014, a Warner perde muito em não investir melhor nesse universo e fazer um upgrade a Marvel recebe os créditos pela qualidade.

      "Review 1: Jagame Thanthiram - 6.5/10. Karthik Subbaraj starts off this misguided gangster film on a really slow and weirdly aimed pace, but revives the film once it hones in on its real intentions: immigration. Starring Dhanush, fresh off of his excellent turn in Karnan, Jagame Thanthiram is a wrongly advertised film. What was advertised as a movie about a gangster who moves from #madurai to London for a paid mission, actually ends up being a movie about the Eelam struggles of refugees fleeing from Sri Lanka, and how a new law being brought forth in the UK parliament could hinder their journey to a new life. Once the movie follows that plot line, the movie shines really well. But sadly, its the badly formed first half that makes you scratch your head and wonder where the film will go. Subbaraj is a talented filmmaker, and is one that understands what kind of story he is trying to tell. This could have felt like a generic gang film, but it does offer some new things here and there. When he hones into the immigration plot line, he really shines his mettle as a writer. Some of the dialogue's really shine and show his anger and passion towards this subject. As for the other positives, Dhanush does a good job as the flawed gangster, who ends up redeeming himself later on. The real highlight of the film is the performance from Aishwarya Lekshmi, who shines as the Eelam refugee who is the love interest of Dhanush's character. Her performance in the dramatic portions are commendable, and she has a good future as a leading heroine. Joju George is good in a limited role along with good work from Kalaiyarasan and James Cosmo. Because of the misguidedness of the beginning portions, it leaves a sour taste for the movie, and its sad that the director didn't make this a full on film about immigration. Even if it were a full on movie about gangs, it could have been interesting, but when mixing these two plot lines it just doesn't execute to the full extent that Subbaraj probably was attempting. A decent film which could have been amazing had the second half been the full film.\n",

      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "Review 2: A \"compilation movie\" of the first thirteen episodes of the anime, Mobile Suit Gundam I excels in galaxy-building and Mecha fighting, which is what I signed up for. Humanity has far exceeded the saturation point for the global population, so colonies float in space orbit with their own societies, but loyal to the Earth Federation. However, a breakaway faction, the Principality of Zeon, has waged war against the Federation to secure its independence. When we arrive, the war has largely come to a stalemate with half of humanity dead — seems like they solved the overpopulation issue. While several characters are introduced, our main protag is Amuro (Brad Swaile), a teenager who, out of necessity, pilots the RX-78–2 Gundam to protect his home colony — the rest is history. While there certainly isn't a dearth of action, the over two hours and fifteen minutes becomes a drag. It definitely made me want to continue with the movies, but I'm not sure I could do the next one, if it's of similar length, in one sitting. The Gundam universe is iconic and my kind of Sci-Fi.\n",

They put the same recording of laughs over and over again for absolutely everything. Second, the actors didn't have the best performance. They overreact and made stupid things without being funny at all. Third, the script is pathetic. They don't really develop any character correctly. Maybe except for Carson and SamSam whom clearly grown up by end of the series. Even though, the central relationship between Se-wan and Jamie is completely force and uninteresting. Due to these reasons is why I do not recommend you to see this series. \n",
      "P.D: If you regarding what I said are going to see it anyway, I would recommend you to not have high expectations of the series. In fact, the only reason why I saw it was because I wanted to support Minnie and Youngjae's work. I believe both deserved a better series to act in.\n",

      "Review 2: I've just seen Bradley Cooper in a quirky comedy Silver Linings Playbook. It's different from most rom-coms (apart from As Good As It Gets) because both Cooper's character Pat and his co-star are mentally ill. The film takes an unromanticised look at the ways in which they struggle with their illnesses, overcome, cope, and learn to live with them. Cooper himself is great in the lead, coming across as sympathetic and vulnerable as well as slightly humourless. The film creates a 'support network' about the couple, including gambling addict/OCD suffering dad (played by an ageing Robert De Niro), one of Pat's former inmates (Chris Tucker), and his best friends, Ronnie and Veronica, who are in a troubled marriage, but seek to aid Pat in his own romantic affairs. The movie has a great 'juke box' soundtrack with many classic pop records, and some nice dancing from Cooper and his partner. Apart from a lot of poor camerawork, this is a very good film and earned several Oscar nominations.\n",

      "Review 3: I wanted to like Lupin, and I might have liked it more if I hadn't been watching the dubbed version. Considering what a genius the fictional Arsene Lupin was imagined to be, Omar Sy's character frequently bordered on the idiotic. For a supposed master of disguise, Sy sticks out like a sore thumb most of the time, and it doesn't help that he's built like a pro football player. The writers/director seemed more concerned with style and less with coherence. It didn't help that the character's fictional hero's name, Lupin, was uniformly mispronounced as \"Lupon\" by all the voices in every episode of the dubbed version. That wouldn't have happened if it were in French, of course, but the whole thing has an air of sloppy self-satisfaction to it, as does the character himself.\n",

It villifies Indian culture and paints Western culture as the right way. The movie has a great underlying story that got tainted by having the two white saviors... I come from a poor country and a poor household and that was in part my story with skateboarding... Without the white saviors!!! The movie is also sexist when it tries to highlight women empowerment... It tries to do too many things and it fails at it all. It's sad how much it villifies a foreign culture simply because it is seen from the lens of Western standards....\n",

Some people might be turned off by how crazy things get, and I acknowledge that there are moments in this movie that are way to dramatized and over the top, to the point that it doesn't feel natural.

A society that reeks of corruption in its core – in which honest individuals like Bello have no chance to earn an honest living without going against their moral integrity and succumbing to corruptible moral and behavioral trends.\n",

      "Review 2: Born from a short-film directed by star Teo Garcia back in 2006, ‘Xtremo' is what you get when you grew up obsessed with 80's/90's action flicks. Like something straight out of that era in almost every way (it could quite easily be a JCVD film), it's super cheesy, very simple, and absolutely loaded with machismo. However, as you might imagine, it's also jam-packed full of silly, but entertaining fights with lackeys being mowed down left and right, succumbing to the grizzled hero who's out for revenge. Depending on what mood you're in, that might just do it for you, if only out of a sense of nostalgia. I just feel like it's very dated. In this day and age, action films need to do better, be more inventive and stylish if they want to stand out. This certainly isn't that, but I haven't seen anything like this come out of Spain before, so respect for trying something different and perhaps blazing the way for future martial arts/action stars.\n",

      "\n",
      "Colin Farrell is Jesse James and Gabriel Macht plays his brother Frank. After the film opens with perhaps the most fun ever had at a Civil War battle, the Jameses and Youngers head home to Missouri. There, evil railroad executives have moved into the state in record time and are trying to buy everyone's land to build a railroad. Farms are burned, people killed, and the Youngers and Jameses have had it. After Ma James (Kathy Bates, here for the paycheck) is killed in an attack, the guys decide to stick it to the man by robbing banks where the railroad company does business. The rest of the film is a series of explosions as the gang robs, Allan Pinkerton (Timothy Dalton) tries to track James down, and the boys escape from one pickle to another.\n",
      "\n",
      "This film is stupid. So stupid. First of all, all the characters are straight out of a screenplay seminar: Jesse the dashing hero, Zee (Ali Larter) his love interest, Frank the smart one, Cole Younger (Scott Caan) the hothead, Bob Younger (Will McCormack) the \"funny\" one, Jim Younger (Gregory Smith) the boy who you know will die, Tom (Nathaniel Arcand) the politically correct Native American Indigenous People Indian Scout guy whose sole function here is to add some color to the cast of white guys, Rains (Harris Yulin) and Parker (Terry O'Quinn) are the villains, Ma James is the religious nut who has no problem with guns and killin', and Pinkerton, who enjoys the chase of James more than the capture. All the young men wear cool clothes and brandish magical pistols that reload themselves. Thank goodness everyone over thirty five is an idiot, so as these rascally killers can go John Woo/Chow Yun Fat all over their gold-filled rumps and do serious damage without ever killing an innocent bystander. Electric guitar riffs fill the soundtrack, and the film goes through all its preordained set pieces where the outcome has already been determined yet the film makers treat them as if they invented the genre. If you need to see cute guys without their shirts on, go online. If you need to see a decent western, watch anything but this. The entire cast and crew should be ashamed of themselves for coming up with this and shooting it. Did we learn nothing from \"The Brady Bunch,\" when Bobby worshiped Jesse James until Mike brought home the son of one of the outlaw's victims? Why is that decades old sitcom more responsible than this dung? Wanna know the kicker to this whole migraine of a movie? Ma James is killed, prompting the boys to take revenge on the railroad. In real life, she outlived Jesse by almost forty years.\n",

The interaction between the protagonist and the inspector is reminiscent of Crime and Punishment. Highly recommended.\n",

Michael Jai White is really good in this. Better than the movie itself.   Good fighting.  A few good cameos. A lot of homage to modern MMA (and Enter the Dragon).   The acting, aside from White, is weak.  Evan Peters is fun.   The directing is good and fight choreography better.  The dialogue is  weak.  The soundtrack is completely dated and out of place.  Yet it all ties together with the whole being bigger than the sum of the parts. MJW fights add a 1/2 star.  You see from the fight scenes why MJW was crowned \"The Black Dragon\" by Ron Van Clief.\n",

      "Review 2: \"Streets of Fire\" is described as a \"Rock N' Roll Fable\". The story is so simple, it could be the opening cut scene to an 8-Bit video game. There is a beautiful singer in the club. An evil biker played by Williem Defoe comes and steals the woman. The sister writes to our hero, Tom Cody, to come and get the singer back. That's the conflict, save the princess from the biker gang.\n",
      "\n",
      "The movie has a really compelling opening with a distinct style and flair. The opening title says this takes place: \"At another time, at another place.\" The setting of this movie is more interesting than the characters themselves. The whole town is constantly bathed in neon lights and wet streets. Smoke comes out of every alleyway; it feels like a Lazer-tag match is about to break out.\n",

      "The setting, music and intro are all top notch. Too bad the rest of the movie does not hold up to that standard of excellence.\n",
      "\n",
      "Or main hero, Tom Cody, is a dull as a plank of wood. He has one emotion, and even that one note he does not play well. He sounds like he is trying to do a Stallone impression but lacks the confidence to go all out on it. Apparently the role was considered for Tom Cruise, and he would have been a much better fit for this role. All the casting feels a bit off. Rick Moranis's script was likely just one word: \"complain\". That is all his character does, he whines about every decision the characters make. At a certain point you ask, \"why was he even brought along?\" I guess MapQuest doesn't exist in \"another time, another place.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Everyone except for Williem Defoe seems to be confused about what the director wants from them. Williem Defoe looks like the devil in this movie, he is doing great. Except for one scene where it sounds like he is trying a Southern Accent. That didn't work, so he stops using it part way through the movie.\n",

      "Review 2: If you were to condense all of the two years of the pandemic that was COVID-19, you would get INSIDE. The hints of suicidal tones, the mess that is a production when you are in the head of an anxious, depressed mind, and the pain that is creativity at times, are all very evident here. In a personal way, this film is a Hell I have faced many times myself, and is an encouraging piece of work to replenish the creative and logistical mind. Bo Burnham creates an atmosphere that is almost terrifying, but very close to the embodiment of how life was in 2020-2021. The music is well-done, the visuals are absolutely astonishing even when placed in one single living area, and the excellency of hurt that Bo portrays is absolutely incredible while also portraying how terrible production and directing can be at times. The B-roll alone is chaotic, but comprehensive when put together altogether in the scope of the mind of Bo. Burnham’s masterpiece should live as a monument in our history books for being the best descriptor of the isolation we faced as an entire world.\n",

      "Review 3: I will be bluntly honest with you. When I decided to turn this movie on during a sick day from work, I entirely expected to tear this movie to shreds. The plot sounded so maudlin and hackneyed that I was inventing horrible adjectives during the opening scenes. Well, 95 minutes later I was wiping tears from my eyes. True, this movie doesn't re-invent the wheel, but what it does, it does exceedingly well, and it's not often that I can recommend a live action family movie that can truly be enjoyed by the whole family. And much of the success of this movie belongs to Gonzales, an actor I don't think I've ever seen before but whose charisma and charm carry the film over a couple rough patches. Quaid, looking shockingly old and haggard, tends to over-do the cranky captain at first, but by the end, he had me hooked. True, it would have been nice to learn more about the orphaned boys rather than cliched mannerisms. And, true, there are a couple moments that even the Hallmark channel would have questioned. But overall, I was touched and moved and thoroughly beguiled - and the fact that this is based on a true story makes everything all the more pleasing. I don't recall a bad word or a moment that wouldn't be acceptable for anyone from baby Ephraim to grandma Phyllis. So grab the opportunity and enjoy - especially if you dig WICKED TUNA.\n",

If Fayza's simple step brings he system to the point of examining its flaws, Seba and Nelly garner the much needed support to provide a platform for the voice of the suffering women. The sound track is excellent and the editing is superb, providing the best support to the clear and commendable cinematography. All the characters have acted so well, it looks as if it is happening in our presence. One of the best films destined to change the perspective of the society in the way it allows such gross injustice to go unpunished.

      "Review 3: Comme quelques tristes faits divers l'ont rappelé récemment, le harcèlement sexuel des femmes dans la sphère publique s'est imposé comme la huitième plaie d'Egypte dans le pays en question, et l'adoption d'une loi sensée protéger les femmes n'a eu que peu d'impact dans la pratique.  C'est après avoir assisté à un procès au cours duquel une des rares femmes ayant eu le courage de porter plainte se voyait renvoyer sa soi-disant responsabilité en pleine figure par le juge, que le réalisateur Mohammed Diab a eu l'idée de cette fiction qui, à travers quelques personnages très différenciés (femme pieuse de condition modeste, grande bourgeoise, jeune artiste éprise de modernité), souligne que le problème n'est pas qu'une affaire de religion ou de condition sociale.  Oeuvre visuellement modeste mais dont la narration éclatée vaut bien celle des films d'Alejandro Innãrritu, \"Les femmes du bus 678\" expose au grand jour le raz-le-bol de ces femmes, attisé par l'immobilité de leurs conjoints et de leurs proches, et décrit les solutions qu'elles trouvent pour faire évoluer les choses, qu'il s'agisse de l'action judiciaire, du militantisme et des groupes de parole ou de l'action directe à l'encontre des harceleurs potentiels.  Si les ficelles narratives du film semblent parfois évidentes, il tombe sous le sens à tous que la vocation militante de ce film, qui s'efforce de mettre la société égyptienne face à ses carences, l'emporte largement sur toute considération artistique ou technique.  On saluera d'autant plus le courage du réalisateur qu'il  se refuse à présenter son sujet comme une simple nuisance occasionnée par quelques prédateurs isolés ; au contraire, il le décrit comme le symptôme le plus apparent de la mentalité qui prédomine dans toutes les couches de la société égyptienne.  Même dans la représentation des personnages les plus \"positifs\" (la belle-famille \"éclairée\" de la jeune artiste, le flic chargé de l'enquête qui comprend très vite de quoi il retourne mais manifeste un manque de volonté évident à arrêter les coupables), on ressent clairement la lourdeur d'un climat qui reste, dans le meilleur des cas, patriarcal et paternaliste et laisser croire que toute possibilité d'évolution des mentalités passera par un processus de (très) longue haleine.  Intéressante mais pas éblouissante en tant que simple fiction, 'Les femmes du bus 678' est plutôt à envisager comme un travail d'utilité publique, qui rappelle que le combat des femmes pour l'égalité et le respect est encore très loin d'être gagné là bas (et à peine plus ici, si on se donner la peine d'élargir le champ d'observation) et offre un tableau précieux, car non monolithique et suffisamment détaché de la grille de lecture occidentale, de la diversité et des courants souterrains qui agitent les société arabes d'aujourd'hui.\n",

The character development was phenomenal especially with Ryan, Karen, and Kim. The performances were outstanding especially from Ryan O'Connell, Punam Patel, Jessica Hecht, Max Jenkins, Lauren Weedman, Buck Andrews, Marla Mindelle, Danielle Perez, Nicole Lynn Evans, Utkarsh Ambudkar, Leslie Jordan, Gina Hughes, Heather Wynters, Karan Soni, Anjali Bhimani, and Ajay Mehta. The chemistry between Ryan and Punam once again was hilarious and very sweet and the chemistry between Ryan and Jessica was great again very authentic and touching. This 2nd and final season of Special was an A+ and I'll say it again that I love seeing more authentic representation of people with disabilities and people who are gay being represented by people who have a disability and who are gay; I'm really gonna miss this show.\n",

      "Writer / Producer Ryan Murphy's 5 part limited series, tells the story of the rise and fall of 70's fashion guru / icon Roy Halston Frowick, better known simply as Halston. Ewan McGregor stars as the titlular character, delivering an incredible, multi-layered, career best performance in a part that could so easily have been a camp caricature. The rest of the cast including Rebecca Dayan as Elsa Peretti, Sullivan Jones as Ed Austin, David Pittu as Joe Eula, and Gian Franco Rodriguez as Victor Hugo are all equally brilliant, but it's Krysta Rodriguez heartwarming turn as Liza Minnelli that will turn casting directors heads. \n",

      "Review 1: This series is just like all the other ones that they constantly stream on free streaming channels that were recorded in the 90s and early aughts. Strangely, many of them seemed to be recorded in Canada (I tend to think of Canadians as the more sane counterpart to Americans but not when it comes to ghosts, apparently). These claim to be \"true stories\" and it has the person telling the story to a small room of friends and even the friends have that \"this person is either crazy or making this stuff up\" look on their faces. Some of the stories are just mind numbingly boring and tend to evolve around an Illness (because, you know, illness is a sign of a demonic presence, lol). Same rules applies as applied in the 90s: If you're going to offer to put people on camera and pay them something, suddenly everyone has a \"omg haunted house\" story. Made up, concocted, contrived, fabricated, not worth your time. Not even worth a review, to be frank about it.\n",

      "Review 1: When your goddaughter recommends a movie, you want to find at least something positive to say about it. But good gravy Marie, this is one BAD movie. This may be the most thrill-less thriller and the most suspense-less suspense movie I've ever seen. Performances across the board are bad bordering on lethargic - it's almost as if everyone is on Propofol. The film spends way too much time on exposition, and what should be the most exciting and climactic parts feel rushed. It's a rather preposterous premise which just grows more and more unbelievable, and the ending is laughable. This is sub-Lifetime Television Movie Event territory here. Thankfully, there are a couple so-bad-they're-good moments that save this from a ZERO star review. But if you're looking for a truly memorable suspense movie, you're barking up the wrong tree here.

Ive always felt a thriller is far more effective when the Villains start off as warm  and inviting . Soon after the illusion of trust is built the turn of events heightens far more effectively. Instead of an unhinged sociopath being  immediately obvious the threat coming from within never fails to instill realism towards true shock and terror.\n",

This South Korean TV series, or K Drama, as they are called, is mesmerizing. All of the characters are interesting and well thought out. Lots of interesting insights into the class differences between the servants and the elite. The plot is great. Looking at all the fancy homes, designer clothes, Volvo luxury cars, and jewels is a fascinating glimpse into their world. After about 10 episodes (watched in 2 days, one hour each) I did wish to hurry up and find out who the killer was. First K-Drama I have seen. Only criticism is could have been 10 episodes instead of 16. Was glad to find this fabulous thriller on Netflix. Oh and most importantly, a look at how women can and will lead and be in power. The two leads are fabulous. As the stepmother and the nanny fight over the small child, there are some great scenes of what a woman will do to stand up to a school bully and his own mother.

      "Review 2: Milestone may be an Indian movie but it depicts a human story of everyday struggles & survival that is global. It is a movie about a truck driver who has just completed 500,000 kms (310685 miles) and is now facing a threat of losing his job to a new kid who he’s been put incharge of training. This movie is a character study of us humans and is layered with many truths. It is a mirror not just to Classism but also to Ageism. How we treat & value young vs the old. And ultimately it is about the low value of human rights over self internet. Labor is considered essential, but is shunned off when it comes to giving them the bare minimum wage raise of just 2 rupees, and are also easily replaceable if needed. A harsh reality that this pandemic has so clearly shown us. Director Ivan Ayr in his second outing after the brilliant Soni again brings his minimalist style of cinema. There is no spoon feeding here. But the screenplay will makes sure that at no point will you feel that the movie is heavy or preachy. At the runtime of 98 minutes the movie doesn’t feel long either. The cast of this movie is made up of lesser known people but everyone’s performance is on point, especially the protagonist driver played by Suvinder Vicky. The emptiness & loneliness he feels despite being surrounded by so many people is haunting. I loved the cinematography of this movie. Cinematographer Angello Faccini beautifully captures the essence of the highway life. This is not your typical Bollywood romanticized version. This is the real world. I highly recommend that you check it out.\n",

      "Review 2: JT LeRoy (2018), directed by Justin Kelly, is a dramatic film, with twists and turns, based on the memoir 'Girl Boy Girl: How I Became JT Leroy' by Savannah Knoop.    It stars Kristen Stewart (Savannah Knoop aka JT Leroy), Laura Dern (Laura Albert), Kelvin Harrison Jr. (Sean), Diane Kruger (Eva), Jim Sturgess (Geoff) and Courtney Love in a cameo appearance as Sasha.\n",
      "It's a dramatic re-telling from the perspective of Savannah Knoop of the literary scam/hoax pulled off by Laura Albert, her sister-in-law, and the author of two semi-biographical books, 'Sarah' and 'The Heart Is Deceitful Above All Things',  later debunked as fake.  \n",
      "Savannah Knoop is roped into masquerading as JT Leroy, the literary persona of Albert's two books.    JT LeRoy is a former teenage sex worker, and a boy.  The androgynous looking Albert, dressed by Knoop in a blond wig and dark sunglasses, resembles the look of JT to a tee.  Albert gets into the action too by acting as JT's handler, Speedie, who speaks in an affected British accent and takes on an irritating personality to go with it.   The American public lap it up and the pair are so convincing that along the way they ensnare Hollywood and European celebrities in their spider web of tales and lies until a journalist from the Guardian finds them out.    It's a marvelous case study about deception and the blurred boundaries between imagined and real identity and the meaning of authenticity.   \n",
      "It's an intriguing film exploring the themes of duplicity and authenticity, two sides of the same coin, and the motif of art imitating life imitating art.   Films about grifters and scammers intrigue me and we have a real whopper here as the exploits of Savannah Knoop and Laura Albert, the ring leader, are romanticized and glamorized for the big screen.  It's a romp of a film glorifying the anti-hero as protagonist and raises intriguing questions of identity both imagined and real, and the motif of unhealthy narcissism, and the love of ego.\n",
      "Kelly weaves together many visual elements and editing techniques to create an intriguing film juxtaposing the narrative of the hoax against the simmering tensions, conflicted emotions, and hostilities between the characters.  The filmmaker uses interstitial titles starting with a pertinent quote from Oscar Wilde \"the truth is rarely pure and never simple\" at the beginning of the film to naming the cities and places (San Francisco, Los Angeles, Paris, Tennessee, Cannes) where the narrative unfolds to structure the film, and ending it with the title 'one year later'.  The film is made up of a stellar cast where Stewart, Dern and Kruger are allowed to play out complex scenes and show us their chops.\n",
      "I highly recommend the film for its acting, superb cinematography, and dialogue.   It's an entertaining film about grifters and a cautionary tale on a grand scale that me think that we are perhaps, susceptible to scams, so, we'd better listen to our guts, y'all!\n",

      "Review 1: One of the biggest wastes of a budget and a story I have ever seen. Incompetence and short-cutting corners leads what could've been an anime epic about a legendary samurai into a jarring mismatch of the most watered-down paint by numbers story you could ever imagine and the overpopulation of too many ideas and no idea what to do with them. Combine this absolute inability to make an interesting story about a preexisting and already interesting story with some of the worst dialog and plot writing that has existed in the modern era and you have Yasuke. This show literally manages to writes itself into a corner within 3 episodes (circling around leaving the village) and outright lies to itself, its' characters, and its' audience multiple times to try and poorly get out of it. Parts of the animation are pretty good, parts of the performances aren't entirely terrible. Save yourself the time and skip this disgrace to a legend.\n",

      "Review 2: I came in with pretty high expectation, then it all went downhill from there. The characters are generic and flat, the writing is inconsistent and it feels like the overall vision was thrown across the table multiple times. The story key moments are highly predictable and it was just all... not interesting. The pretty art did not help. Yasuke could literally be replaced by any generic protagonist and it would have all been the same. It starts out pretty decently with beats that keeps you at your seat, but the show quickly dwindles down into generic slop of boring tropes and got even worse with the nonsensical final arc. I don't recommend wasting your time watching this.\n",

    "Wanneer de URL correct is opgebouwd, word de lijst in de for-loop gezet en wordt er een GET-verzoek gestuurd naar de pagina met de reviews. Er is een vertraging van 0.5 seconden ingebouwd tussen de verzoeken, om te voorkomen dat de server overbelast raakt. Als de pagina word geladen controleert het script of de statuscode 200 is. Hierna word de HTML van de pagina geparsed met `BeautifulSoup`.\n",

    "De beoordelingen worden verzameld uit de `<p>` tag m.et de class `audience-reviews__review js-review-text`. De sterren worden uit de `rating-stars-group` tag gehaald. Om de belasting van de server te verminderen, en de draai tijd van de code te verminderen, worden er max drie reviews per titel opgehaald. Als er geen sterrenbeoordeling beschikbaar is, word er 'N/A' ingevuld.\n",
    "\n",
    "De code houdt rekening met eventuele foutmeldingen. Wanneer een film of serie niet op Rotten Tomatoes staat, of als er geen beoordelingen beschikbaar zijn, wordt dit gelogd. Zo is het makkelijker te achterhalen waar iets misgaat en kan er gecontroleerd worden of de fout in de code of de website ligt.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tot slot worden de reviews en sterren overzichtelijk geprint. Dit maakt het makkelijk om de resultaten te analyseren, en eventuele fouten sneller op te kunnen lossen. Daarnaast geeft het snel een goede indruk of de code werkt."

    "2. Normaliseren van Titel namen: Om overeenkomstige titels te vinden tussen neftlix_k en api_data worden de titels genormaliseerd door. \n",
    "    - Alles om te zetten naar kleine letters.\n",
    "    - Spaties te vervangen door underscores. Dit voorkomt verschillen in naamgeving zoals hoofdletters of spaties.\n",

    "3. Unieke waarden vaststellen: Dubbele waarden in de api_data worden verwijderd voor het mergen van de api_data en Neftlix_k\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Matchen van Titels: De titels van netflix_k en de namen van api_data worden vergeleken en moet een nieuwe kolom status toe.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Data voorbereiden voor Machine Learning: De kolommen worden aangepast om te voldoen aan machine learning:\n",
    "    - Type: film worden aangegeven met een 0 en series met een 1\n",
    "    - average sentiment: positive sentiment wordt veranderd in een 3, neutral sentiment wordt 2, Negative sentiment wordt 1 en no reviews wordt 0.\n",
    "    - duration: De duration kolom is opgesplitst in twee kolommen, Film duration (voor films, uitgedrukt in minuten) en seasons (voor series, uitgedrukt in seizoenen)\n",
    "    - Country: Eerst is bij de country kolom gekeken of er meerdere landen bij stonden hier hebben wij altijd het eerste land gepakt. De country kolom is daarna omgezet naar de continenten kolom sinds er te veel verschillende landen waren voor dummies of omzetten in nummers. Per land zijn zij omgezet naar het bijhorende continent uiteindelijk zijn hier dummies van gemaakt. rijen waar geen land bij stonden is unknown mee opgevuld voor het maken van de dummies.\n",
    "    - Ratings: Er zijn dummies gemaakt van de age ratings\n",
    "    - listed_in: bij de listed_in kolom, de genres, was er erg vaak sprake van meerdere categorieën. Wij hebben de genres verminderd naar alleen de eerste en hier daarna ook weer dummies van gemaakt.\n",
    "    - Status: van status hadden wij erg weinig opgevulde waardes sinds deze van de API kwamen, de missende waardes hebben wij opgevuld met 'unknown' en daarna hebben wij weer dummies gemaakt. Status bestond uit, ended, returning series, cancelled en planned. \n",
    "    - Andere kolommen waarvan wij geen numerieke waarden van konden maken of niet relevant genoeg waren zijn verwijderd. \n",

    "- Normalisatie van de titels: dit zorgt ervoor dat de data consistent is en helpt bij het matchen van de titels tussen de datasets.\n",
    "- vervangen van NaN-waarden: het invullen van NaN-waarden is ook preprocessing omdat de ontbrekende gegevens worden aangevuld zodat de modellen beter zullen werken.\n",
    "- Splitsen van duur en seizoen: dit is preprocessing omdat de data geherstructureerd wordt zodat de informatie duidelijker en geschikter is voor verdere analyse.\n",
    "- verwijderen van kolommen: het verwijderen van show_id, director enzo. is een preprocessing stap.\n",
    "- omzetten van de rating en genres splitsen: dit is een preprocessing-stap omdat de gegevens worden getransformeerd voor bruikbaarheid voor modelleren.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature engineering, richt op het creeren van nieuwe kenmerken die het model kunnen helpen. Dit zijn de stappen:\n",
    "- het creeren van de continent kolim: hierin wordt een nieuwe feature gemaakt vanuit de country kolom.\n",
    "- Dummies voor continent, rating en status: het omzettenvan categorische variabelen naar numerieke waarden met behulp van dummies is feature engineering. \n"
