      "Review 1: This is a documentary that will hit many different people in many different ways depending on their past and present life experiences. Without getting too personal, in some ways I am living out a bit of what is happening in this movie and found parallels that are eerily accurate, including a need to help figure out the TV that happened just a few hours earlier today. As a result, this was a rather extraordinary experience for me. I'll be honest - when I first read the description of this movie, it sounded a bit off kilter, and I think it could have gone terribly wrong in numerous ways. But director/daughter Johnson is a smart cookie and finds a beautiful balance between the pain and the humor. While I expected to be moved - and I most certainly was - I was surprised by how often I smiled and laughed throughout. And it helps that Dick Johnson is just the loveliest man ever, a kind and gentle soul whose smile lights up a room and whose spirit is inspiring to us half his age. There are moments here I will truly never forget, and I'm not being hyperbolic. I think this will touch anyone who has gone through or is going through the experience of having an elderly parent or parents. Alternately hilarious and heartbreaking, I'll be thinking of Dick Johnson for a long time to come.\n",

      "Review 2: More admirable than it is artistically satisfying, most of the credit I give to Sankofa is due to the attempt to convey a compelling story about the events leading up to an eventual plantation uprising during the times of slavery, and to a certain extent it succeeds in doing so, as it's pretty difficult to watch at times in its uncompromising violence. Though the non existent budget they had to work with shows, and the film could have used a firm editing hand as there's not enough content to justify more than two hours in length, it's not an experience that's completely tarnished.\n",

      "Review 3: I lost my husband suddenly and tragically a little over a year ago. I have been a lot like Lily's character. I appreciate that the movie brought out the fact that the main characters were already the way they were when faced with the loss of their child. I also liked that they didn't say there were \"answers\" to grief. Mental fog is a real thing too. That was one of the scariest things to deal with, especially returning to my job just one week after my husband's death. Thankfully, my errors were not as significant as some of Lily's. I liked how the vet continued to use his therapeutic skills to help his clients. So needed. I appreciated the interactions between all the different characters that showed the complexity of human experiences. It's a really good film to cause one to think, feel, and develop a heart of understanding and compassion for others.\n",

      "Review 2: Ok, but this was horrible. I wish I could give it 0 stars. It's not the animation, or anything like that, it's the story. It's HORRIBLE. It's changed everything of the original My Little Pony. And it literally says that the ponies hated each other, even though the series already did that and solved it...  and how did Sunny turn into a alicorn so quickly? It's just a bad storyline... and it ruined my childhood. It should have been the Mane 6.\n",

      "Review 2: More admirable than it is artistically satisfying, most of the credit I give to Sankofa is due to the attempt to convey a compelling story about the events leading up to an eventual plantation uprising during the times of slavery, and to a certain extent it succeeds in doing so, as it's pretty difficult to watch at times in its uncompromising violence. Though the non existent budget they had to work with shows, and the film could have used a firm editing hand as there's not enough content to justify more than two hours in length, it's not an experience that's completely tarnished.\n",

      "Review 3: I lost my husband suddenly and tragically a little over a year ago. I have been a lot like Lily's character. I appreciate that the movie brought out the fact that the main characters were already the way they were when faced with the loss of their child. I also liked that they didn't say there were \"answers\" to grief. Mental fog is a real thing too. That was one of the scariest things to deal with, especially returning to my job just one week after my husband's death. Thankfully, my errors were not as significant as some of Lily's. I liked how the vet continued to use his therapeutic skills to help his clients. So needed. I appreciated the interactions between all the different characters that showed the complexity of human experiences. It's a really good film to cause one to think, feel, and develop a heart of understanding and compassion for others.\n",
